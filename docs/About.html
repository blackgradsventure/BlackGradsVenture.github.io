      <h3>About BGV</h3>
      <p>Black Grads Venture is a grassroots organization committed to reimaging what the PhD experience looks like for Black students pursing higher education.</p>
      <p> Pursuing higher education can feel like a rite of passage, especially for PoC. The excitement we feel when we see another Black person “cross the finish line” is unmatched! Many academics will tell you that science will be challenging because you’re basically doing what’s never been done. Although that may be true, what they fail to mention is that the “difficulty” of a PhD program often comes from an  institution's environment and the systemic issues that plague academia.
          It does everyone an extreme disservice when we aren’t truly honest about our experiences for the sake of “Black excellence”. There is nothing “excellent” about being underpaid and having inadequate healthcare. Black Grads Venture, BGV, serves as a safe haven for Black PhD students to build a community, have hard conversations and also think of creative solutions to combat these issues. Additionally, BGV is also a learning space where we design creative ways, like our annual retreat, to share our expertise with each other and the generation after. </p>
