      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>Our Mission is to make the PhD experience a lot more enjoyable for Black students.</p>
      <p>Here, we're reminded that our research for our communities is important. Here, we're allowed to make mistakes and ask “stupid” questions. Here, in the midst of anti-blackness, we're free to think creatively about what care looks like for ourselves, our peers and our communities. Here, we'll support each other’s endeavors, whether academic or not. Here, we're allowed to prioritize our mental health and venture outside the lab to do things that make us feel good. Here, we won’t be made to feel bad for doing such things. Black Grads Venture is a call to action to those who’ve been silent and complicit, all while benefiting from a system that preys on the most vulnerable people and communities. This is us fighting back! </p>
