      <h3>The Retreat</h3>
      <p>BGV's annual retreat will be one of the most anticipated events of the calendar year! Escape for a fun-filled weekend getaway where you can decompress and spend time with other BGV members. This retreat aims to be both fun and informational. Day 1 will be a travel day. The importance of that day will be to ensure folks are safe and acclimated to each other. Days 2&3 will be dedicated to recreational activities such as hiking. Hiking, in particular, symbolizes all the unique traits you gain as a PhD student (endurance, perseverance, grit…etc.). Other activities that focus on wellness and mindfulness will happen on Days 2&3, as well. Day 3 will end with a farewell dinner and an open dialogue about the work we’ve accomplished thus far and what next steps look like for the future. </p>

      <p> We here at BGV understand how financially stretched Black PhD students are. There isn’t much wiggle room for expeditions, as such. Therefore, it is our goal to raise enough money to cover most, if not all, travel expenses for BGV members to alleviate any financial stress this may cause.</p>
